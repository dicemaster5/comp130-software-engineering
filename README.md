## My essay question: When should you use Vertex animations over Skeletal animations in games

## How I will answer the question:
I will be answering this question by researching the different ways in which vertex animation has been used over skeletal animation and analyzing why
that decision was made to conclude with some good reasons to why you wouldn't always want to use skeletal animations. From what I have researched so far I know that vertex animations have
been very helpful for solving all kinds of processing power issues, especially in older video game titles. I also know that Vertex animations are still heavily used within modern games and
might be called something else depending on what engine you are using. Unity has shaders which can use vertex animation to distort the mesh it's on to create interesting animations, Unreal has
something called static mesh instancing. I also want to look at vertex animations for 2D games and how they could be used instead of making 2D sprite animations to help simplify certain animation
tasks. Discussing the difference in processing speed each animations takes is also another important subject I want to talk about.

I will also answer the question by looking at what players think looks better when it comes to certain animation types on different game objects such as characters, environmental objects and visual effects.
knowing what the player thinks about the animation style is a good indication on whether you should use it or not.


## topics I want to talk about
- procedural animations
- Hybrid animations
- environmental and creature animations
- the positives and negatives of each animation type
- how the animations could be used together
- 2D vertex animations
- processing cost of each animation type
